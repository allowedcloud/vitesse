# vitesse

_Work in Progress_

My fork of vite starter template, [vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse).
Changes so far are mix of preference and neccessity.
Anything stylistic has been stripped.
Though, I have included a color palette.
The biggest addition is [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) and
[Cypress](https://cypress.io).
Also, [PostCSS](https://postcss.org) has been configured to allow
[nested styles](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested).
